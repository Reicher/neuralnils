# Neural Nils

Some kind of persistent artificial neural network, meant to be ran like a daemon with sockets and shit.

A fixed number of 64bit integers as input and a fixed number of 64bit outputs. Continuous training, evaluation and evaluation to tune biases and extend or shrink the network for optimization.
